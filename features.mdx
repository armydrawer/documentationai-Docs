## Page and Section Organization

You organize your documentation into pages and sections using a hierarchical structure. Create top-level pages for major topics like "Getting Started" or "API Reference," then nest subsections for deeper dives.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Page" icon="plus">
    Navigate to your space and click "New Page." Enter a title and add YAML frontmatter for metadata.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Nest Sections" icon="folder">
    Drag pages into folders or use sidebar indentation to create hierarchies.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reorder Content" icon="move">
    Use drag-and-drop in the navigation sidebar to adjust order.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Use consistent naming conventions like "verb-noun" for actions (e.g., "install-package") to keep your structure intuitive.

## Content Editing and Formatting Tools

Edit content directly in the browser with live previews. Aleksandr Kislitsyn supports full MDX, so you combine Markdown with interactive JSX components for richer docs.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Basic Formatting" icon="type">
    Use standard Markdown for text:

````markdown
# Heading (avoid in body)

**Bold** and _italic_ text.

`Inline code` for variables like `{API_KEY}`.
````
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Code Examples" icon="code">
    Add highlighted code blocks:

````javascript
// Realistic API call example
const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/users', {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${YOUR_TOKEN}` }
});
const users = await response.json();
console.log(users);
````
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Components" icon="layers">
    Embed components like `<Callout>` for notices.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Collaboration and Sharing Features

Invite team members to collaborate in real-time. You assign roles like Editor or Viewer, track changes, and share public links.

<CodeGroup tabs="Invite,Share">
```javascript
// Generate invite link via API
const inviteUrl = await api.post('/spaces/{spaceId}/invites', {
  email: 'team@company.com',
  role: 'editor'
});
```
```bash
# CLI command for sharing
ak-docs share --space my-project --public --token YOUR_TOKEN
```
</CodeGroup>

<Expandable title="Advanced Permissions" default-open="false">
  Set granular permissions per section:

  | Role     | Edit Pages | Publish | Manage Users |
  |----------|------------|---------|--------------|
  | Viewer   | No         | No      | No           |
  | Editor   | Yes        | No      | No           |
  | Admin    | Yes        | Yes     | Yes          |
</Expandable>

## Search and Navigation Functionalities

Navigate effortlessly with a global search bar that indexes all content. You search by keywords, filter by section, or use breadcrumbs for hierarchy.

    A[Home] --> B[Docs]
    B --> C[Features]
    C --> D[Search]
    D --> E[Results]
